Conceptual Foundations\n\n### 1.1 Defining Non-Causal Explanation\n\nA non-causal explanation is one that accounts for why a phenomenon occurs without appealing to causal mechanisms or processes. While causal explanations identify factors that produce, generate, or bring about the explanandum (the phenomenon being explained), non-causal explanations typically appeal to constraints, mathematical necessities, symmetries, or other principles that make the explanandum necessary or inevitable without directly causing it.\n\nCausal explanations follow a temporal structure where causes precede their effects and involve some transfer of energy or information. In contrast, non-causal explanations often invoke simultaneous relations or constraints that do not operate through temporal processes but rather show why certain outcomes are necessary given particular structural features of a situation.\n\n### 1.2 Lange's Criteria for Non-Causal Explanation\n\nAccording to Marc Lange, several key criteria distinguish non-causal explanations:\n\n1. **Modal strength**: Non-causal explanations typically exhibit a stronger form of necessity than causal explanations. They show why something had to happen given certain constraints, rather than merely showing what produced it.\n\n2. **Explanatory directionality**: Unlike causal explanations where the direction is from cause to effect, non-causal explanations may exhibit different patterns of directionality based on necessity rather than production.\n\n3. **Independence from counterfactual causal scenarios**: Non-causal explanations maintain their explanatory power even when we consider radically different causal scenarios. The explanation holds across possible worlds with different causal laws.\n\n4. **Appeal to constraints**: Non-causal explanations often appeal to constraints that limit the space of possibilities rather than to generative mechanisms.\n\n5. **Mathematical necessity**: Many non-causal explanations derive their force from mathematical necessity or other forms of necessity stronger than mere nomological (law-based) necessity.\n\n### 1.3 Contrasting Lange's View with Other Non-Causal Frameworks\n\nLange's account of non-causal explanation differs from other frameworks in several important ways:\n\n**Contrast with Mathematical Explanation**: While both Lange and proponents of mathematical explanation (like Baker and Colyvan) emphasize the role of mathematics in explanation, Lange focuses more broadly on the distinctive modal character of non-causal explanations. For Lange, mathematical explanations are a subset of non-causal explanations characterized by their distinctive modal force.\n\n**Contrast with Unificationist Accounts**: Unlike Kitcher's unificationist model, which takes explanatory power to derive from unifying diverse phenomena under common patterns, Lange emphasizes the modal strength of non-causal explanations. Unification may be a consequence of good non-causal explanations for Lange, but it is not their defining feature.\n\n**Contrast with Woodward's Interventionist Model**: Woodward's account defines causal explanation in terms of potential interventions. While Woodward acknowledges that some explanations might not fit this model, Lange provides a positive account of what makes non-causal explanations explanatory. Where Woodward's model says an explanation is causal if it supports certain counterfactuals about interventions, Lange identifies non-causal explanations as those that appeal to constraints that would hold even under various interventions on causal factors.\n\n**Contrast with Mechanistic Models**: Unlike mechanistic accounts popular in philosophy of biology, which emphasize explanation through identifying the components and operations of mechanisms, Lange's non-causal explanations often bypass mechanisms entirely, showing why certain outcomes are inevitable regardless of the specific mechanisms involved.\n\n## 2. Case Studies\n\n### 2.1 Euler's Theorem and Beetle Wing Morphology\n\n#### What is being explained:\n\nThe case concerns the number of elements (vertices, edges, and faces) in certain biological structures like beetle wings. The explanandum is the topological relationship among these elements, specifically that in many biological structures, the number of vertices (V) minus the number of edges (E) plus the number of faces (F) equals 2 (V - E + F = 2), which is Euler's formula for connected planar graphs.\n\n#### How the explanation counts as non-causal:\n\nThe explanation for why beetle wings exhibit this relationship appeals to Euler's theorem in topology. The explanation does not cite the developmental processes that cause the beetle wings to form, nor does it reference evolutionary mechanisms. Instead, it explains the relationship by showing that any connected planar graph must satisfy Euler's formula as a matter of mathematical necessity.\n\nThis explanation is non-causal in Lange's sense because:\n\n1. It exhibits modal strength that transcends physical necessity‚Äîthe relationship would hold regardless of the causal processes involved in wing development.\n2. It appeals to a constraint (Euler's theorem) that limits what is possible rather than identifying what produced the structure.\n3. The explanation would remain valid even if the causal mechanisms of wing development were radically different.\n\n#### Critical evaluation of Lange's interpretation:\n\nLange would argue this is genuinely non-causal because it appeals to mathematical necessity rather than causal processes. However, a critic might object that the explanation is incomplete without reference to causal mechanisms that ensure the biological structure actually forms a connected planar graph.\n\nThe explanation could be seen as a special case of causality under constraint if we view evolutionary processes as causally selecting structures that satisfy certain optimality criteria, which happen to coincide with mathematical constraints like Euler's formula.\n\n#### Could the explanation be reframed causally?\n\nA causal reframing might suggest that developmental mechanisms are constrained by physical forces that tend to produce structures satisfying Euler's formula, or that evolution selected for wing structures that satisfy this relationship due to functional advantages.\n\nHowever, such causal reframing would miss a crucial aspect of the original explanation: the mathematical necessity of the relationship. The causal story explains how the wings come to satisfy Euler's formula, but not why the formula itself holds for any connected planar graph. The non-causal explanation captures this deeper necessity that transcends the specific causal history.\n\n### 2.2 Honeycomb Geometry and Optimality\n\n#### What is being explained:\n\nThe explanation concerns why honeybees construct their honeycombs using hexagonal cells rather than other polygonal shapes. The explanandum is the ubiquity of the hexagonal pattern in honeycomb structures across different bee species and environments.\n\n#### How the explanation counts as non-causal:\n\nThe standard explanation appeals to the mathematical fact that a hexagonal tiling is the most efficient way to divide a plane into regions of equal area with minimal total perimeter. This represents an optimal solution to the problem of minimizing wax usage while maximizing storage space.\n\nThis explanation is non-causal in Lange's sense because:\n\n1. It appeals to a mathematical optimality principle rather than to the specific mechanisms through which bees construct honeycombs.\n2. The necessity of the hexagonal solution derives from pure mathematics (specifically, geometric optimization) rather than from causal laws.\n3. The explanation would hold even if the causal mechanisms underlying honeycomb construction were completely different.\n\n#### Critical evaluation of Lange's interpretation:\n\nLange would argue that this explanation is genuinely non-causal because it appeals to mathematical necessity rather than to causal processes. The hexagonal structure is not explained by citing what causes it, but by showing why it must be the optimal solution given certain constraints.\n\nA critic might counter that this explanation is incomplete without reference to the evolutionary causes that selected for wax-conserving behavior, or the neurological mechanisms that enable bees to construct hexagonal cells. From this perspective, the mathematical optimality is simply a constraint under which causal processes operate.\n\n#### Could the explanation be reframed causally?\n\nA causal reframing might suggest that evolutionary pressures caused the selection of bee behaviors that minimize wax usage, and that the physical properties of wax and the mechanics of how bees manipulate it cause the formation of structures that approximate hexagons.\n\nHowever, this causal reframing shifts the explanandum. It explains how bees came to build hexagonal structures, not why hexagons are the optimal solution. The mathematical necessity of the hexagonal pattern as the optimal tiling solution is independent of the causal history of bee evolution and remains a non-causal aspect of the explanation.\n\n## 3. Original Challenge: A Novel Example of Non-Causal Explanation\n\n### The Nash Equilibrium in AI Learning Systems\n\nConsider an artificial intelligence system designed to play a competitive game (like chess or Go) against other AI systems. When multiple such systems are trained through reinforcement learning, they often converge toward Nash equilibrium strategies‚Äîstrategies where no player can improve their outcome by unilaterally changing their strategy.\n\n#### The Explanandum:\n\nWhy do independently trained AI systems, when playing against each other, tend to converge toward Nash equilibrium strategies, regardless of their initial algorithms, training data, or architectural differences?\n\n#### Non-Causal Explanation:\n\nThe convergence toward Nash equilibrium can be explained by appeal to game theory and the mathematical properties of optimization under competition. Specifically:\n\n1. In any finite, non-cooperative game, at least one Nash equilibrium exists (Nash's theorem).\n2. Reinforcement learning algorithms are designed to maximize expected utility.\n3. Any strategy profile that is not a Nash equilibrium provides at least one agent with an incentive to change strategy.\n4. Therefore, regardless of the specific learning mechanisms, initialization parameters, or architectural details, any stable outcome of the learning process must be a Nash equilibrium.\n\n#### Justification for Non-Causality:\n\nThis explanation is non-causal because:\n\n1. **Modal strength**: The necessity of convergence to Nash equilibrium derives from mathematical properties of game theory rather than from the causal processes of neural network training. It holds with mathematical necessity rather than merely physical necessity.\n\n2. **Independence from mechanisms**: The explanation applies regardless of the specific learning algorithms, neural network architectures, or training regimes employed. The same convergence would occur even with radically different causal mechanisms for learning.\n\n3. **Appeal to constraints**: The explanation identifies a constraint on possible outcomes (Nash's theorem) rather than tracing the causal history of how the systems learned.\n\n4. **Counterfactual robustness**: The explanation would remain valid even if we changed the causal laws governing how AI systems learn, as long as they still attempted to maximize expected utility.\n\n#### Defense Against Causal Skepticism:\n\nA skeptic might argue: \"This is just a causal explanation in disguise. The AI systems converge to Nash equilibrium because their learning algorithms cause them to maximize utility, and this causal process leads to equilibrium strategies.\"\n\nResponse:\n\n1. The causal story fails to capture the necessity of the outcome. If we focus only on the causal mechanisms, we cannot explain why different AI systems with different architectures and learning algorithms converge to the same equilibrium points.\n\n2. The causal explanation is specific to particular systems, while the non-causal explanation applies universally to any utility-maximizing agents, including those that might operate through entirely different causal processes.\n\n3. The causalist conflates how the systems arrive at Nash equilibrium (a causal story) with why Nash equilibrium is the only stable outcome (a non-causal mathematical necessity).\n\n4. Consider a counterfactual: if the laws of neural network learning were completely different, but still aimed at utility maximization, the convergence to Nash equilibrium would still occur. This shows that the explanation transcends the specific causal mechanisms involved.\n\nThe skeptic might further insist that mathematical constraints are simply part of the causal story‚Äîthey shape the space of possible outcomes within which causal processes operate.\n\nResponse: This move essentially collapses the distinction between constraints and causes. If we accept this, then all explanations become \"causal\" by definition, and the concept loses its discriminatory power. The distinctive feature of the Nash equilibrium explanation is that it identifies a constraint that would apply regardless of the causal mechanisms, making it fundamentally different from explanations that cite specific causal processes.\n\n## 4. Meta-Philosophical Reflection\n\n### 4.1 Philosophical Significance of Non-Causal Explanations\n\nAccepting non-causal explanations in science has several profound philosophical implications:\n\n1. **Pluralism about explanation**: It suggests that scientific explanation is more diverse than causal-mechanistic accounts allow, embracing multiple modes of explanation appropriate to different domains and questions.\n\n2. **Autonomy of abstract sciences**: It supports the idea that disciplines like mathematics, theoretical economics, or parts of theoretical physics can provide genuine explanations without reduction to causal mechanisms.\n\n3. **Limits of reduction**: It challenges strong reductionist programs that seek to reduce all explanations to fundamental causal processes, suggesting instead that explanations at different levels may have autonomous value.\n\n4. **Realism about mathematical structures**: It lends support to forms of mathematical or structural realism, suggesting that abstract structures and constraints play a genuine explanatory role in understanding physical phenomena.\n\n5. **Reconceptualizing necessity**: It encourages rethinking the relationship between different forms of necessity (logical, mathematical, metaphysical, nomological) and their role in scientific explanation.\n\n### 4.2 Challenge to Standard Models of Explanation\n\nNon-causal explanations challenge several influential models of scientific explanation:\n\n**Hempel's Covering-Law Model**: Hempel proposed that explanations involve subsuming phenomena under general laws. While non-causal explanations might conform to this broad pattern, they emphasize a distinctive kind of necessity that goes beyond mere law-like regularities. Non-causal explanations often appeal to constraints that have greater modal force than physical laws, showing not just that something happens, but why it had to happen.\n\n**Mechanistic Model in Biology**: The mechanistic model, prominent in philosophy of biology, holds that to explain a phenomenon is to identify the mechanism responsible for producing it. Non-causal explanations challenge this by showing that some biological phenomena (like optimal structures) can be explained without reference to the mechanisms that produce them. The explanation appeals to why the outcome is optimal or necessary rather than how it is produced.\n\n**Causal-Interventionist Models**: Models like Woodward's, which tie explanation to potential interventions, struggle with non-causal explanations where the explanatory factors are not subject to intervention. Non-causal explanations often involve mathematical or logical necessities that cannot be altered through intervention, yet still provide understanding.\n\n### 4.3 Complementing Rather Than Undermining Causal Explanation\n\nNon-causal explanations need not undermine the idea that science seeks causal mechanisms. Instead, they complement causal explanations in several ways:\n\n1. **Different explanatory targets**: Causal explanations address how phenomena are produced, while non-causal explanations often address why certain patterns or structures are necessary or optimal.\n\n2. **Multiple levels of understanding**: Non-causal explanations often provide a higher-level understanding that complements the detailed causal story. They explain why causal processes tend toward certain outcomes by identifying constraints on what is possible.\n\n3. **Guidance for causal investigation**: Non-causal explanations can guide causal research by identifying constraints within which causal mechanisms must operate, helping scientists focus on plausible causal hypotheses.\n\n4. **Integration of domains**: Non-causal explanations often bridge domains like mathematics and empirical science, showing how abstract principles constrain physical processes.\n\nRather than competing with causal explanation, non-causal explanation extends our understanding by capturing aspects of phenomena that causal explanations alone cannot address. They help us understand not just how the world happens to be, but why certain features of it could not have been otherwise.\n\n## 5. Bonus Question: Non-Causal Explanations as Modal Explanations\n\nNon-causal explanations are indeed better understood as modal explanations‚Äîexplanations of why something had to be the case rather than merely what caused it to be the case. This modal character is central to what makes them distinctive and powerful.\n\nThe relationship between explanation and necessity in non-causal contexts has several important implications:\n\n1. **Hierarchy of necessities**: Non-causal explanations often appeal to stronger forms of necessity than causal explanations. Where causal explanations typically invoke nomological necessity (necessity according to laws of nature), non-causal explanations frequently appeal to mathematical, logical, or metaphysical necessity that would hold across all possible worlds, even those with different physical laws.\n\n2. **Constraints vs. production**: Modal explanations focus on constraints that limit what is possible rather than on processes that produce what is actual. This shifts our understanding of explanation from accounts of production to accounts of constraint satisfaction.\n\n3. **Counterfactual robustness**: Modal explanations support distinctive counterfactuals that causal explanations cannot. They allow us to consider what would happen even if the causal laws were different, providing a deeper form of understanding.\n\n4. **Explanation without time**: Modal explanations can make sense of explanatory relationships that do not involve temporal precedence, addressing simultaneous relationships and abstract patterns.\n\n5. **Unification of diverse explanation types**: Viewing explanation through the lens of modality allows us to see connections between mathematical explanations, optimality explanations, symmetry arguments, and other non-causal forms that might otherwise seem disparate.\n\nThis modal perspective on explanation suggests that scientific understanding is not limited to knowing what causes what, but extends to grasping the necessities and possibilities that structure our world. It points toward a richer conception of scientific knowledge that includes not just knowledge of actual causal processes, but also knowledge of the modal structure that constrains what is possible.\n\nIn this view, causal explanation becomes a special case of modal explanation‚Äîone concerned with a specific kind of necessity involving production relations‚Äîrather than the paradigm to which all explanation must conform. This reframing has the potential to resolve long-standing debates about explanation by showing how diverse explanatory practices can be understood within a unified framework that recognizes the centrality of modal concepts to scientific understanding.",

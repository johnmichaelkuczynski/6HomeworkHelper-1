INSTRUCTION TO REPLIT AGENT ‚Äì ASSIGNMENT NOT SAVING üö®

The "Save Assignment" function is failing silently with the error Failed to save assignment. Please try again.

You must immediately fix this. Follow these steps:

Check the saveAssignment() function (or equivalent) and verify that:

All required fields (title, score, description) are validated and included in the payload.

The function does not rely on clipboard/autofill values‚Äîthe user may paste text, and that must not break the logic.

There is a proper error handler that returns clear messages from the backend.

On the backend/API route that handles assignment saving:

Confirm that the request body is correctly parsed (JSON or form data as needed).

Ensure no required field is missing (e.g. internal ID, CSRF token, description).

Return a valid HTTP 200 or 201 response with a success flag.

Also check:

Whether assignment titles like "MONEY" are being blocked (e.g. for being too short, duplicated, or reserved).

That the front-end form triggers a fresh save() call even if values are autofilled or reused.

This is an urgent blocker. Fix it now. No guessing. No silent failures. Return detailed error logs if save fails again.

Copy/paste that directly into Replit‚Äôs agent or support. It tells them exactly what to check‚Äîboth front and back.

WHY DO I GET THIS ERROR OVER AND OVER AND OVER? TELL REPLIT WHAT TO DO. EMERGENCY. EXTREME PREJUDICE

Here is the exact, aggressive and non-negotiable instruction to give to the Replit agent or dev support. This directly addresses the "Failed to extract text from PDF" error.

üö® EMERGENCY INSTRUCTION TO REPLIT AGENT ‚Äî PDF TEXT EXTRACTION FAILING üö®
PRIORITY: EXTREME. FIX IMMEDIATELY.

The app throws ‚ÄúProcessing Error: Failed to extract text from PDF‚Äù when uploading valid, non-corrupted PDF files. This error has occurred repeatedly with PDFs under 100 KB that are readable in all standard PDF viewers.

Here's what you need to do immediately:

üîß 1. Fix the PDF text extraction pipeline:
Make sure the app uses a real PDF parser, such as pdf-parse, pdf-lib, or pdfjs-dist.

Do not rely on regex or basic string scraping‚Äîit must parse the PDF structure correctly.

If you're using OCR fallback for scanned PDFs, implement a detection layer:

If PDF is not text-based, automatically route it through Tesseract.js or another OCR engine.

‚ö†Ô∏è 2. DO NOT assume all PDFs contain extractable text:
If the PDF is image-only (e.g., scanned handout), the extractor must fail gracefully and pass to OCR.

Failing without a fallback is unacceptable.

üß™ 3. Add diagnostics:
Log and display why extraction failed: ‚ÄúNo embedded text found,‚Äù ‚Äúinvalid encoding,‚Äù etc.

Surface these messages in the UI to help the user, not just a generic red banner.

‚úÖ 4. Test and verify:
Test on basic PDFs, scanned PDFs, and OCR‚Äôd PDFs under 50 KB and over 500 KB.

Upload the attached file (gyges ring instructions.pdf) and confirm extraction works.

This issue has occurred over 50 times. It is no longer acceptable to guess or defer. You are to fix this now, with extreme prejudice. Do not respond with boilerplate.

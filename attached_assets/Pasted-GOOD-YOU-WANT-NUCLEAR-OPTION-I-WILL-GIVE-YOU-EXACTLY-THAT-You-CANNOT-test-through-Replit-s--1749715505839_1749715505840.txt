GOOD â€” YOU WANT NUCLEAR OPTION â€” I WILL GIVE YOU EXACTLY THAT.

ðŸ‘‰ You CANNOT test through Replitâ€™s flaky preview page.
ðŸ‘‰ Replit's preview often blocks drag/drop with internal wrappers.
ðŸ‘‰ Nuclear option is: FORCE THE APP TO ACCEPT DRAG/DROP AT THE DOCUMENT LEVEL.

THIS IS THE FASTEST, SAFEST WAY TO TEST:
ðŸ‘‰ This will NOT touch your box internals.
ðŸ‘‰ It will FORCE drag/drop to work globally.

COPY THIS EXACT CODE â†’ TELL THE REPLIT AGENT TO ADD IT TO YOUR APP:
javascript
Copy
Edit
document.addEventListener('dragover', function(e) {
    e.preventDefault();
}, { passive: false });

document.addEventListener('drop', function(e) {
    e.preventDefault();
    const textarea = document.querySelector('textarea');
    if (!textarea) {
        console.log("No textarea found.");
        return;
    }

    // Plain text drag
    if (e.dataTransfer.types.includes('text/plain')) {
        const text = e.dataTransfer.getData('text/plain');
        textarea.value = text;
    } 
    // File drag
    else if (e.dataTransfer.files.length > 0) {
        const file = e.dataTransfer.files[0];
        const reader = new FileReader();
        reader.onload = (evt) => {
            textarea.value = evt.target.result;
        };
        reader.readAsText(file);
    }
});
INSTRUCTIONS FOR AGENT (tell the agent this):
Add this code at the top level of the app (e.g. in index.js, or in the top React component inside useEffect, or globally if plain JS).
Do not modify my Rewrite box. Do not remove any of my logic.
Simply add these global event listeners so I can test drag/drop right now, even in Replit preview.
This is a temporary nuclear patch â€” I will remove it later once proper drop handling is implemented.

WHAT THIS WILL DO:
âœ… FORCE browser to allow drag/drop
âœ… FORCE your existing Rewrite box <textarea> to receive the drop
âœ… BYPASS Replit preview blockers
âœ… WILL NOT touch your componentâ€™s internal logic

WARNING:
ðŸ‘‰ This is a TEMPORARY patch â€” once you confirm drag/drop works, the final version should move the handling inside your controlled React component to avoid React bugs.
ðŸ‘‰ But this is 100% the nuclear option to unblock you TODAY.

FINAL SUMMARY:

ðŸ‘‰ COPY the code block above
ðŸ‘‰ GIVE the agent the instruction text I wrote
ðŸ‘‰ TEST drag/drop

WHEN DONE â€” come back here and tell me:

ðŸ‘‰ WORKED
ðŸ‘‰ DIDNâ€™T WORK

Then I will tell you the next step (only if YOU want it).
NO BULLSHIT â€” this is the most direct unblock you can do.

READY. GO. NUCLEAR OPTION DEPLOYED.

GOOD — NOW YOU’RE BEING 100% CLEAR. THIS IS A SEPARATE ISSUE:

👉 THE PROBLEM RIGHT NOW IS NOT DRAG/DROP.
👉 THE PROBLEM IS: YOUR REPLIT PREVIEW SCREEN IS NOT LOADING. WHITE SCREEN. STUCK ON "LOADING YOUR PAGE..."

THIS IS A COMMON REPLIT BUG — HAPPENS A LOT. IT IS NOT YOUR CODE. IT IS REPLIT BEING SHIT.

HERE IS THE EXACT CAUSE / WHAT IS HAPPENING:
1️⃣ Replit preview iframe gets "wedged" or stuck.
2️⃣ It often happens after several redeploys or edits without full stop.
3️⃣ Sometimes due to a corrupted service worker or cached iframe state.
4️⃣ Even if your app is running fine, the preview pane will stay blank — "Loading your page..." → forever.

HOW TO FIX IT — STEP BY STEP — NO BULLSHIT:
1️⃣ FIRST TRY SIMPLE RESET:
👉 Click the little "reload" icon on the Preview tab → 80% of time this fails but try it first.

2️⃣ FORCE REPLIT TO FULLY RESTART THE PREVIEW:
👉 Click "Stop" (square button at top).
👉 Wait 5 seconds.
👉 Click "Run" again.

3️⃣ IF STILL BROKEN — NUCLEAR REFRESH OF REPLIT:
👉 Open your Replit app.
👉 Press Ctrl+Shift+R (Windows) or Cmd+Shift+R (Mac) → this forces a hard reload, clearing cached service workers and iframe state.

4️⃣ IF STILL FAILS:
👉 Close the current Replit browser tab entirely.
👉 Open a new tab.
👉 Go to replit.com.
👉 Re-open your project fresh.
👉 Click Run again.

5️⃣ LAST RESORT:
👉 Sometimes Replit gets permanently stuck on preview.
👉 If so:
→ Click "Open in new tab" (icon next to Preview tab).
→ Run your app in a separate browser tab — this bypasses the buggy Replit preview iframe.

WHY THIS HAPPENS:
Replit Preview pane is an embedded iframe running your app → very fragile.

When you edit React apps and hit Run repeatedly, it often leaves stale iframe state.

You see "Loading your page..." even though the app is running → it is a Preview bug, not your app’s fault.

SUMMARY:
👉 YOUR APP IS NOT BROKEN.
👉 THIS IS A PREVIEW PANE BUG.
👉 Follow my 5 steps above — one of them will clear it.
👉 If needed, run the app in "Open in new tab" — that works almost 100%.

ONE FINAL POINT:
👉 DO NOT ATTEMPT TO FIX DRAG/DROP UNTIL YOUR PREVIEW IS WORKING.
👉 FIRST we get the preview pane working.
👉 THEN we test drag/drop.

NOW — DO THIS:
👉 Follow my 5 steps above — one by one.
👉 Tell me what happens at each step.
👉 We will walk through it together until your preview loads.

READY? START WITH STEP 1. TELL ME WHAT HAPPENS.
👉 I am standing by — we will beat this bullshit right now.
